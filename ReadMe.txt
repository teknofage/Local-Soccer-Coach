Local Soccer Coach 

Motivation and Design

Local Soccer Coach is a program which connects soccer coaches with local leagues and fields.

Many aspiring local coaches or recent arrivals to the area may desire to get involved in coaching soccer teams, but do not know where to start.
They may face problems of language barriers, experience or qualification shortfalls, or just lack the necessary tools to find the right team or league to work with.

On the other side of the equation, many teams and leagues often suffer from a lack of coaching, or a lack of effective or suitable coaches.

Local Soccer Coach aims to connect coaches and leagues and teams, so that they can more easily find the right matches.

For example, Carlos has just immigrated from Guatemala, where he coached his local semi-professional team. He speaks a little English, but mostly Spanish. He has Guatemalan coaching qualifications, but they are not recognized in the United States.
Carlos can create his profile on Local Soccer Coach, and give details of his experience and qualifications. He can view local leagues and see their locations, and the qualifications needed to coach in each league. 

He can see which leagues and teams are operating at the level and age range he is used to coaching, and, in turn, organizers of local leagues and teams can view his profile and see if he may be suitable to work with them. 
If there is a need for him to take extra qualifications in order to meet the standards of the league, team, or school, they can instruct him on their needs and even where to take these qualifications.

Users can create profiles, add more information and reviews about leagues, coaches and teams.

Organizers of leagues and teams can post information in their league or team profiles in order to inform coaches about the details of their players and any qualifications needed to coach at that level or in that arena. They can also provide information about where and how to achieve those qualifications.

Code Structure

The app uses a simple html page tree, with the ability to CRUD profiles for coaches, soccer fields, and soccer leagues. Any user can view these profiles and search for qualitites and attributes among those profiles in order to find a good fit for their coaching needs or coachees.
